The simple shell project:
                             Description:

This project represents the implementation of a custom shell program, developed as part of a Milestone Project for the C programming curriculum at ALX Africa's Software Engineering program. Titled "The Gates of Shell," this project is part of the first trimester coursework. It is designed to help students gain a deeper understanding of the advanced concepts underlying shell programs, such as process management, system calls, bitwise operations, file management, and error handling, among others.

The shell itself functions as a basic UNIX command interpreter, replicating many of the core features and functionalities found in the simple shell (sh). The entire program is written in the C programming language, showcasing a practical application of C in systems programming.
